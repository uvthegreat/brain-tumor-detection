# Brain Tumor Detection Model

Building a detection model using a convolutional neural network in Tensorflow & Keras.
Used a brain MRI images data founded on Kaggle. Based on prediction tumor is classified into glioma, meningioma, pituitary or there is no tumor at all.

## Dataset

The dataset is taken from kaggle and it is MRI images.

## Model

The model is built using deep learning modules such as tensorflow, keras, scikit learn.

1. **Data Preprocessing**:

   - Handling missing values.
   - Scaling or Normalizing features if necessary.

2. **Model Training**:

   - Split the data into training and test sets.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) metrics.

## Results

The final model achieved the following impressive results on the test set:

- **Accuracy : 79%**
